# User Monitoring Dashboard

This is a simple web-based dashboard that displays users currently in the monitoring queue, highlighting those exhibiting risky behavior.

## Features

- **User Display:** View a list of users in the monitoring queue.
- **Risk Indication:** Users with risky behavior are highlighted in red, while normal users are highlighted in green.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify the user data and adapt the code to fit specific requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

The dashboard provides a quick overview of users and their behavior. The sample user data is provided in the `script.js` file and can be modified to reflect real-world scenarios.

### Customization

Feel free to customize the code to suit your specific requirements. Some ideas for customization include:

- **Dynamic Data:** Fetch user data dynamically from a server or external API.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Implement real-time updates to reflect changes in the monitoring queue.
- **Detailed Information:** Add more detailed information about each user for a comprehensive view.


**Note:** Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL if you are hosting the code on a version control platform like GitHub. Additionally, replace `[Your Name]` with your name or the name of the project's primary contributor. If your project has a specific license, provide details in the `LICENSE` file and reference it in the README.
